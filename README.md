# CalendarApp

## Overview
CalendarApp is designed to help users manage their events efficiently by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly interface.
The app allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely using Firebase Authentication.
Users can create, edit, and delete events, each with details such as title, description, date, time, and whether it is a repeating event.
These events are displayed on a calendar, allowing users to easily view and navigate their schedules.
The app uses Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and synchronization, ensuring that users' data is consistent and accessible across multiple devices.
Additionally, the app features event notifications to remind users of upcoming events, helping them stay organized and on schedule.
The modern and intuitive design, utilizing Material Design components, ensures a seamless user experience.
Overall, CalendarApp addresses the common problem of disorganized event management by offering a centralized platform where users can keep track of their important dates and activities, thereby enhancing productivity and organization.

## Technical Details
- **Tools**:

  - **Material Components**: For building a modern and intuitive user interface.
  - **RecyclerView**: For displaying a large set of data in a scrollable list.

- **Architectural Pattern**:
  - **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Separates the app's data and business logic (Model) from the UI (View) and the logic that binds the two (ViewModel).

- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Singleton for Firebase Initialization**: Ensures only one instance of the Firebase database is created and used throughout the app.
